## Inspiration
Twigane was born from the desire to make language learning more engaging, personalized, and effective. Traditional language learning methods often lack interactivity and fail to adapt to individual learning styles. We wanted to create a platform that combines the power of AI with gamification to make language learning both fun and efficient. it was built with the thoughts of people who struggle with ADHD

## What it does
- Personalized learning paths using AI
- Interactive language games and quizzes
- Real-time conversation practice with AI
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance
- Gamified learning experience with points and achievements
## How we built it
- Frontend: React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile development
- Backend: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- AI Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 for conversation and content generation
- Database: MongoDB for user data and progress tracking
- Vector Database: Pinecone for semantic search and content retrieval
- Authentication: JWT for secure user sessions
- State Management: React Context and Hooks
## Challenges we ran into
- Implementing real-time AI responses while maintaining performance
- Creating adaptive learning algorithms that balance challenge and engagement
- Handling complex state management for game sessions
- Optimizing AI response times for better user experience
- Ensuring data consistency across different learning modules
- Managing memory usage with large language models
